            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Cameron Lauterbach, owner and operator of the Blue Ridge
              Canine Academy. I have spent the last 3 years as a canine
              professional developing my skills with the help of amazing mentors
              and world renowned teachers.</p>

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>As a young kid I loved spending time with my family dogs and taught
              them many tricks in our backyard. But it wasnâ€™t until we got Nala in
              2017 that I started to learn the ins and outs of dog training. While
              in college we decided to foster a dog, teach it house manners and
              obedience before finding it a forever home. We brought Nala home and
              quickly learned around either without barking and lunging. Even
              though we were able to create a good foundation in obedience, these
              behaviors led us to find a professional trainer. This is where I
              decided I wanted to study dog training and psychology so I could
              help others in a similar situation.</p>

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p> A year into my training career, I found my way into the sport dog
              world. After falling in love with the loyalty and relationships
              between dog and handler, I decided to get my own German Shepherd and
              begin training for protection sports - Mondio RIng, and IGP. I spent
              most of 2019 and 2020 working as the head trainer of a small
              facility and had the opportunity to work with a large quantity of
              dogs. This gave me the opportunity to take dogs to a very high level
              of obedience and was able to change the lives of many families. I
              worked with many families who came to us as their last hope and I
              loved seeing their dog transform from a difficult case to a family
              companion.</p>
